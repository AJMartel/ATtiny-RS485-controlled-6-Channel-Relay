# ATtiny Serial/RS485 controlled 6 Channel Relay
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Board consists of a **ATtiny2313** controlled 6 channel Relay which can be controlled by either **Serial(TTL)** /**RS485** /**SPI** or **I2C** Protocol.

The board provides easy and cost effective means to **interface and control 6 SPDT relays** to your microcontroller board like Arduino/AVR/8051/Raspberry Pi or PIC using a two wire serial protocol.

The built in ATtiny2313 microcontroller along with the **MAX485 RS485 tranciever chip** can be used for decoding various protocols like **ModBUS**.

##Features
