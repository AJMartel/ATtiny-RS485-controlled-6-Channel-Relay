# ATtiny Serial/RS485 controlled 6 Channel Relay

The Board consists of a **ATtiny2313** controlled 6 channel Relay which can be controlled by either **Serial(TTL)** /**RS485** /**SPI** or **I2C** Protocol.The board helps you to save precious microcontroller pins by using serial protocols for control and coordination.

The board provides easy and cost effective means to **interface and control 6 SPDT relays** to your microcontroller board like Arduino/AVR/8051/Raspberry Pi or PIC using a two wire serial protocol.

The built in ATtiny2313 microcontroller along with the **MAX485 RS485 tranciever chip** can be used for decoding various protocols like **ModBUS**.

##Features

 - **ATtiny2313** based Microcontroller for Protocol Decoding and control
 - 3 pin MAX485 based **RS485 Port** for controlling the Relays using RS485 protocol.
 - **6 SPDT Relays** rated at 7A/250VAC
 - 3 bit Address selection using Jumpers for networked opeartion
 - **SPI** based Relay Control 
 - **I2C** based Relay Control 
 - **RS485** based Relay Control 
 - **Serial (TTL)** based Relay Control 
 - Indicator LED's to visualize relay status
 - Built in Voltage regulator for  connecting with standard 12V DC adapters 
 - Software support in **C** (for ATTiny) and **C#** (for PC based Control).
